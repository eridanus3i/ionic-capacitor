        Once upon a time in a quaint little village nestled at the edge of a vast forest, there lived two best friends
        named Luna and Milo. Luna was a spirited young girl with eyes as bright as the morning sun, and Milo was a
        mischievous boy with a heart as wild as the forest itself. Together, they shared a bond stronger than the
        tallest
        trees that surrounded their village.
      </p>
      <p class="text-select">
        One sunny morning, Luna and Milo set out on an adventure into the heart of the Enchanted Forest. They had heard
        tales of its wonders and mysteries, and they were determined to discover its secrets. With a map drawn by Milo
        and
        a sack full of snacks, they ventured forth, their hearts filled with excitement and curiosity.
